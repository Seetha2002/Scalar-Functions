The terms literal and constant value are synonymous and refer to a fixed data value. For example, 'JACK', 'BLUE ISLAND', and '101' are all character literals;
5001 is a numeric literal. Character literals are enclosed in single quotation marks so that Oracle can distinguish them from schema object names.

Types of Literals:
Text Literals
Integer Literals
Numeric Literals
Interval Literals

Text Literals
Text specifies a text or character literal. You must use this notation to specify values whenever 'text' or char appear in expressions, conditions, 
SQL functions, and SQL statements in other parts of this reference. This reference uses the terms text literal and character literal interchangeably.

Numeric Literals
Use numeric literal notation to specify fixed and floating-point numbers.

Integer Literals
You must use the integer notation to specify an integer whenever integer appears in expressions, conditions, SQL functions, and SQL statements
described in other parts of this reference.

Interval Literals
An interval literal specifies a period of time. You can specify these differences in terms of years and months, or in terms of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Oracle Database supports two types of interval literals, YEAR TO MONTH and DAY TO SECOND. Each type contains a leading field and may contain a trailing field. The leading field defines the basic unit of date or time being measured. The trailing field defines the smallest increment of the basic unit being considered. For example, a YEAR TO MONTH interval considers an interval of years to the nearest month. A DAY TO MINUTE interval considers an interval of days to the nearest minute.
If you have date data in numeric form, then you can use the NUMTOYMINTERVAL or NUMTODSINTERVAL conversion function to convert the numeric data into interval values.
Interval literals are used primarily with analytic functions.
